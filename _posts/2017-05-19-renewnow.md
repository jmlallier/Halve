## Project Summary
Renew Now CEU is a continuing education course provider for various medical professions. We were hired to develop a site/web app where students could enroll in courses, browse the content, and be quizzed on their knowledge in one space. It needed to handle text, video, and image course content, quizzes with variable question/answer pairs (true/false, multiple choice), and generation of official certificates. The site reports passing grades to a continuing education brokerage through an API that uses a student's license number to officiate the credits. 

I was given the role of lead developer and had full responsibility of the project from day one to launch. I had a blast, though it was a tough project with many challenges. I learned many things throughout the process and I am a much stronger programmer because of it.

## Conclusion
I thoroughly enjoyed developing this site/web app. It was my first project as lead dev and also my first from-scratch project in this job. I learned so many things! AJAX finally clicked, I learned the Square API and about using data types as a significant aspect of optimization. I learned how much I don't know.  I learned about project/directory structure, organization, and abstraction. I learned how effective planning on paper can be prior to writing code or creating table structures or pretty much any other digital thing.
