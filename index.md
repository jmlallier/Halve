# I'm John-Michael

I'm a full-stack web developer and a passionate learner with an entrepreneurial mindset. I constantly iterate on personal and professional processes, workflows, and methods. I'm proficient in PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, AJAX, HTML, CSS, and various APIs. And I'm familiar with MVC frameworks (Laravel and Rails), WordPress, Git, Node, React, and Ruby on Rails.

I'm passionate about my marriage and my family, travel and adventure, and learning and experimenting. I'm a highly-motivated, self-driven individual with excellent people skills and a high tolerance for challenges and new environments/experiences.
