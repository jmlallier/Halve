# John-Michael L'Allier

I was homeschooled K-12, which taught me to be an eternal student. Every day was self-paced learning and I was fully responsible for understanding my coursework, finding additional learning resources textbooks weren't enough, and finishing my assignments on time. 

Knowing how to learn is probably my single most valuable asset, and I'm pretty great at it. Every week I read dozens of articles and reports and listen to several hours of podcasts spanning a wide variety of topics. I also spend a lot of time asking questions and figuring things out. I love it!

I've spent several years of my adult life abroad, starting with living in Japan and South Korea (where I turned 18) for a year without family. My greatest passions in life are my family (my wife, my future children, my parents and siblings), travel (for new experiences and meeting new people), and learning.  In all my interactions, it is my mission to add value to others.

Through all these things, I have become a highly-motivated, self-driven individual with excellent people skills and high tolerance for stress, challenges, and new environments.
